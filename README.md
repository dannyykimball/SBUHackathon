# Pearl

Pearl is a Student made web application that allows users to buy and sell products with people around them.
Utilizing MongoDB, express, and  socket.io this application allows users in real time to buy and sell products!

## Installation

Navigate to the website [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install NodeJS for your dedicated hardware.

## Usage

Run the [cmd.bat]() file and wait for the message on the terminal to print out

```bash
listening on *:3000
```
(If you are experiencing errors make sure you're cd is in the correct file path!!!)
Once this message is printed out, go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to enter the main Login Screen.

## Creating an Account

Once you create an account the details go up to the cloud(MongoDB) and are stored there even after the page is closed/refresed.
The system throws errors at you if you decide to log-in without entering a correct email/password so make sure you type carefully!
